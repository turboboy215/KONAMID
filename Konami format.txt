A header for a song is stored as follows:
1. ?
2. Channel mask

1234 5678
   1-2 = Unused?
   3 = Channel 4 music
   4 = Channel 3 music
   5 = Channel 2 music
   6 = Channel 1 music
   7 = Channel 4 SFX
   8 = Channel 1 SFX
3-4. Channel 1 pointer
5-6. Channel 2 pointer
7-8. Channel 3 pointer
9-10. Channel 4 pointer

Format 2 (Nemesis/Castlevania 2):
1234 5678
   1 = Unused?
   2 = Channel 4 music
   3 = Channel 3 music
   4 = Channel 2 music
   5 = Channel 1 music
   6 = Channel 4 SFX
   7 = Channel 2 SFX?
   8 = Channel 1 SFX

Format 3 (Motocross Maniacs):

Commands
=======================================
xy (00-DF) = Play note (X = note, Y = length - 0 = 16)
    0 = Rest
    1 = C
    2 = C#
    3 = D
    4 = D#
    5 = E
    6 = F
    7 = F#
    8 = G
    9 = G#
    A = A
    B = A#
    C = B
    D = C (octave higher)
E0 xx yy zz = Set channel speed, duty (waveform on channel 3), fade out (only first two are used for noise)
    For games from 1993 onwards, the second byte is split into x and y: octave and speed
E1-E6 = Set octave
E7 xx = Set channel speed
E8 xx = Set note decay?
E9 xx = Set channel pan?
EA 0x = Transpose channel up
EA 1x = Transpose channel down
EA 7x = Transpose channel up (later games)
EA 8x = Transpose channel down (later games)
EA xx = Set instrument
EB xx yy = Set portamento up
EC xx yy = Set portamento down?
ED xx = Set envelope?
EE xx = Set tempo? (higher value is slower)
EF xx = Set panning?
F0-FA = Set note volume? (F0 = "normal", FA = quietest)
F8 xx = ?, used for TMNT 2
F9 02 xx xx = For Goemon (J) and later games?: The second time this is encountered, jump to the address X
FB = Start of repeat point - for later format, an additional one with XX after means repeat # of times
FC = Return from jump - for later format, used as a secondary repeat which functions like FB
FD xx xx = Go to position - for later format, an additional one means to return from jump
FE xx = Repeat section starting from FB value, xx = Amount of times, if FF then jump to loop point? For later format, just start/end of loop point?
FF = Stop track
